KEEP MODELS RUN

TOPIC 8:
 Study the learning process of a neural network (e.g., epochs required for learning, 
error trend on training and validation sets, accuracy on the test set) with a single layer of 
internal nodes and using the sigmoid activation function, varying the early-stopping 
criterion. 
Referring to the article “Early Stopping — But When? Lutz Prechelt, 1999”, 
consider the two early-stopping algorithms GL and PQ with different values for the 
parameter α\alpha.
